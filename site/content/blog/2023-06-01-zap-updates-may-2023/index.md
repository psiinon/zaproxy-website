Welcome to our monthly updates blog post!
Join us as we reflect on the work done on ZAP in May, which includes some exciting new features around authentication, the AJAX spider, and the GraphQL add-on.

{{< thanks-sponsors >}}

## Highlights

### Authentication Tester
The Authentication Helper add-on now adds a new Authentication Tester dialog which can be used to test and configure authentication in ZAP.
Read the [blog post](/blog/2023-05-23-authentication-tester/) for more information.

### AJAX Spider Element Exclusion
{{< callout-lavender >}} This feature was sponsored by [**NightVision**](https://www.nightvision.net/). {{< /callout-lavender >}}

The AJAX Spider now allows excluding elements from being crawled, for example, to prevent log outs while crawling the target app.
The exclusions can be configured by XPath, Text, and Attribute via the GUI, API, and the automation framework.

### Improved GraphQL Support
**Spidering**  
The GraphQL add-on has better spidering support, which means it should be able to detect GraphQL endpoints in web applications with more accuracy.
An alert is raised if the discovered endpoint supports introspection.

**Fingerprinting**  
The add-on also alerts you if it is able to detect the specific GraphQL implementation being used by the server. It draws inspiration from fingerprinting techniques used in the tool [graphw00f](https://github.com/dolevf/graphw00f).

### HUD Announcement
The HUD is no longer under active development.
The HUD is a unique and innovative interface that we know some people love. However, it also needs a non trivial amount of maintenance and we donâ€™t have enough volunteers to maintain it.
If you are interested in becoming a maintainer of the HUD, please [reach out](https://groups.google.com/group/zaproxy-hud)!

## Other Significant Changes

### Active Scan Bug Fix
A core bug pertaining to stopping active scans was [fixed](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/pull/7883).

### Node.js API Client Release Candidate
A new version of the Node.js ZAP API client was released and published to the [npm repository](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zaproxy).
Please try it out and [provide feedback](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-api-nodejs/issues)!

### AMF add-on Retirement
The AMF add-on is being retired. Dependencies of the add-on are no longer reliably available and the add-on is less important with Flash being EOLed.

## Ongoing Work
### Selenium 4
[Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) v4 has been out for a while and we are actively working on updating ZAP to use it.
Zest has been updated to use the latest version. Other add-ons will be updated soon.

### Improved Modern Web App Handling Support
{{< callout-lavender >}} This feature is sponsored by [**Jit**](https://www.jit.io/zap?utm_source=zapproxy&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=zap-proxy-website-banner). {{< /callout-lavender >}}

We're actively working on making it easier for ZAP to test modern web applications.

### Global Rate Limiting
There is an [open pull request](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-extensions/pull/4011) (by a first time contributor!) to support rate-limiting all outbound HTTP requests made by ZAP.

## Google Summer of Code
Two students - [Aryan](https://groups.google.com/g/zaproxy-develop/c/2y3HM1zy3bI/m/9LEoWQRWAQAJ) and [Vitika](https://groups.google.com/g/zaproxy-users/c/pArhbMJw5KA/m/bzGCsZlFBwAJ) - were selected to work on ZAP this year :tada:! They're working on the following projects:

### Import Postman Definitions
Vitika is working on allowing ZAP to import Postman definitions, which will enable ZAP to parse and attack API endpoints contained in them. [Read more](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/projects/OlBxaE5X).

### ZAP Browser Recorder
Aryan is working on the [ZAP Browser extension](https://github.com/zaproxy/browser-extension) which will enable users to record client-side browser interactions and replay them in ZAP. [Read more](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/projects/lx6XL1Rd).
