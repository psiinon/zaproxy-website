We believe that security tools should be available to everyone, which is why ZAP is one of the very few security tools that is both fully internationalised and translated into many languages.

### ZAP Desktop

You can help translate the ZAP Desktop via the [Crowdin: ZAPROXY](https://crowdin.com/project/zaproxy) project.

You can signup to Crowdin for free, and if you'd like to translate ZAP to a language not on the list then let us know and we'll add it in.

Once you sign in you will see that there is a lot to text to translate in many different files.

A good place to start is the file which contains the language strings for the ZAP Core - this is `Home/core/Messages.properties` in Crowdin.

An automated task copies any new translations into the relevant repository.

The 'Core Language Files' add-on can be released at any time - let us know if you think we should release a new version.

The Live and Weekly ZAP releases will automatically pick up the latest translations, the main release will pick up the latest translations when it is generated.

### ZAP Desktop User Guide

You can help translate the ZAP [Desktop User Guide](/docs/desktop/) via the [Crowdin: ZAP Help](https://crowdin.com/project/zap-help) project.

Translating the Desktop User Guide is significantly more work than translating the ZAP Desktop so we now tend to only add the option
to translate to new languages once the ZAP Desktop has been mostly translated into the relevant language.

The User Guide translations are released as their own separate add-ons - search for 'help' on the [ZAP Marketplace](/addons/).

We typically only create a new help translation add-on once the translations have reached 5% on Crowdin - if you've translated more than 5% and we have not yet released a help add-on for that language then let us know!
