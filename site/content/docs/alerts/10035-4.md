A HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header was found, but HSTS headers are ignored on plain (non-HTTPS) responses.
HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a web security policy mechanism whereby a web server declares that complying user agents (such as a web browser) are to interact with it using only secure HTTPS connections (i.e. HTTP layered over TLS/SSL).
