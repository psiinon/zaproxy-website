Information was stored in browser sessionStorage.
This is not unusual or necessarily unsafe - this informational alert has been raised to help you get a better understanding of what this app is doing. For more details see the Client tabs - this information was set directly in the browser and will therefore not necessarily appear in this form in any HTTP(S) messages.
