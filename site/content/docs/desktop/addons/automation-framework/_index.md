# Automation Framework

This add-on provides a framework that allows ZAP to be automated in an easy and flexible way.

It provides the following command line options:

* -autorun \<filename\> Run the automation jobs specified in the file.
* -autogenmin \<filename\> Generate template automation file with the key parameters.
* -autogenmax \<filename\> Generate template automation file with all parameters.
* -autogenconf \<filename\> Generate template automation file using the current configuration.

If the `-autorun` option is used with the ZAP `-cmd` option then the ZAP exit value will be set as follows:

* 0 - The plan completed successfully with no errors or warnings
* 1 - The plan reported one or more errors
* 2 - The plan reported no errors but one or more warnings

Whether the plan completed after encountering errors or warnings will depend on the settings used in the [environment](/docs/desktop/addons/automation-framework/environment/).

To use the automation framework:

1. Generate a template automation file using one of the `-autogen*` command line options
2. Edit the file to match your requirements
3. Run the file using the `-autorun` commandline option e.g. `./zap.sh -cmd -autorun config.yaml`

In most cases it is recommended to also use the `-cmd` command line option so that the ZAP desktop is not displayed and ZAP exits as soon as it has finished generating or running the jobs defined in the file. However you can choose to run Automation Framework jobs using the ZAP desktop to help you debug issues.

## Authentication

The Automation Framework supports all of the [authentication](/docs/desktop/addons/automation-framework/authentication/) mechanisms supported by ZAP.

## GUI

A [GUI](/docs/desktop/addons/automation-framework/gui/) is under development and provides an ever increasing set of features.

## Options

The [Automation Options](/docs/desktop/addons/automation-framework/options/) screen allows you to configure specific options.

## API

The following API endpoints are provided by this add-on:

* Action: runPlan(filePath) - loads and asynchronously runs the plan in the specified file, returning a planId
* View: planProgress(planId) - returns the progress details for the specified planId

If the ZAP desktop is being used then the plan will also be shown in the GUI to make it easier to diagnose any problems.

## Environment

The [environment](/docs/desktop/addons/automation-framework/environment/) section of the file defines the applications which the rest of the jobs can act on.

## File Paths

All file and directory paths can either be absolute or relative to the directory containing the plan. Relative paths are recommended for portability.

## Jobs

The following automation jobs are supported by this add-on:

* [addOns](/docs/desktop/addons/automation-framework/job-addons/) - add-on management, now deprecated
* [delay](/docs/desktop/addons/automation-framework/job-delay/) - pauses the plan for a specified period of time or a specific condition is met
* [passiveScan-config](/docs/desktop/addons/automation-framework/job-pscanconf/) - passive scan configuration
* [passiveScan-wait](/docs/desktop/addons/automation-framework/job-pscanwait/) - waits for the passive scanner to finish processing the current queue
* [requestor](/docs/desktop/addons/automation-framework/job-requestor/) - crafts specific requests to send to the corresponding targets
* [activeScan](/docs/desktop/addons/automation-framework/job-ascan/) - runs the active scanner

[Job tests](/docs/desktop/addons/automation-framework/tests/) can be added to jobs to check that the jobs have performed as expected.

This framework is plugable and so other add-ons may add support for other jobs, see the
[Automation Framework](/docs/automate/automation-framework/) website pages for a more complete list.

The 'min' and 'max' templates include comments giving more information about the fields.
